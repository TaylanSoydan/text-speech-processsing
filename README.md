Note:
process_eda_machine_learning.ipynb includes the data processing, EDA and classical ML. The data is saved there as pickle files to be used again for the deep_learning.ipynb notebook to avoid reading and processing twice. One should uncomment the save cell in the main notebook and run it and use the output pickles for the deep_learning.ipynb
